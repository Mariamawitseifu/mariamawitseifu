## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! Iâ€™m maryamawit, a code ninja by day and a literature enthusiast by night. I wrangle JavaScript with Next.js, tame Python with Django, and sometimes I even speak fluent HTMLâ€”though I canâ€™t guarantee itâ€™ll be grammatically correct! ðŸ˜„

My toolkit includes Node.js, Odoo, Tailwind CSS, and a variety of databases like SQLite, Postgres, and MongoDB. Iâ€™m also known to Docker my way through projects, and I might just be the worldâ€™s greatest fan of RESTful APIs (seriously, theyâ€™re my jam).

When Iâ€™m not busy debugging my latest masterpiece, you can find me hunting for the best local drinks or binge-watching medical series (no spoilers, please!). I believe that every great project starts with a good mug of flavoured tea and a slightly chaotic whiteboard session.

Iâ€™m passionate about Agile methodologies, the Software Development Life Cycle, and collaborating on open-source projects that make the world a little more awesome. Letâ€™s build something great together!

Feel free to explore my repositoriesâ€”just be warned: my old code might make you cringe a little! Maybe I should make them private... okay, Iâ€™ll do that now! Bye! ðŸ¤“
