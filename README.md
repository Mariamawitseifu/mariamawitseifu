## Hey there! 👋
I’m **maryamawit**, a code ninja by day and a literature enthusiast by night. I wrangle JavaScript with Next.js, tame Python with Django, and sometimes I even speak fluent HTML—though I can’t guarantee it’ll be grammatically correct! 😄

### My Toolkit:
- ⚙️ **JavaScript** (Next.js)  
- 🐍 **Python** (Django)  
- 🟢 **Node.js**  
- 🐍 **Odoo**  
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS**  
- 💾 **Databases**:  
  - SQLite  
  - Postgres  
  - MongoDB  
- 🐳 **Docker**  
- 🔗 **RESTful APIs** (seriously, they’re my jam!)

When I’m not busy debugging my latest masterpiece, you can find me hunting for the best local drinks or binge-watching medical series (no spoilers, please!). I believe that every great project starts with a good mug of flavored tea and a slightly chaotic whiteboard session.

I’m passionate about collaborating on open-source projects that make the world a little more awesome. Let’s build something great together!

Feel free to explore my repositories—just be warned: my old code might make you cringe a little! Maybe I should make them private... okay, I’ll do that now! Bye! 🤓
